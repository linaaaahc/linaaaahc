- 👋 Hi, I’m @linaaaahc
- 👀 I’m interested in sooo many things. I could go on forever about they infinite number of hyperfixations I've gone through since my childhood, all the way from becoming an expert in solitaire, to studying how fake gurus make persuasive scam courses, but for now? I love singing and studying/making music. I spend my time on various volunteering projects and am learning pythong :))
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python. However, due to already knowing HTML and some CSS, I want to develop my Web development skills. Also that CS50 course seems so fun: I started it and can't wait to continue!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever comes up lol.
